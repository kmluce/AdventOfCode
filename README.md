# AdventOfCode
Am I tired of creating a repo for each year of advent of code?  Yep.  Let's put them in a single repo from now on.

Not just from now on, actually; I successfully merged my old repos into this one.

Note that I started learning Python in late 2020.  Currently, you can really see the progression in the code.
I may eventually refactor the older code as a learning exercise.
